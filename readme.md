## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Node.js (for JavaScript-based servers)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Noufal/MCP.git
cd N-MCP
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies for specific projects:
```bash
# For Python projects
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Node.js projects (e.g., Notion-server-)
cd Notion-server-
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` (found in crash-course) and add your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# Add other required keys
```
